# NUSModded

NUSModded is a project that aims to assist students of NUS, especially freshmen with module planning.

Entering university, a common issue faced by many freshmen is planning out their module selection, be it for that semester or the years ahead. New students may get confused as they are introduced to many new terms such as prerequisites or corequisites. Currently, the method most students use for their module planning is to search online for their respective courseâ€™s requirements and similar study plans, or seek advice from seniors. 

However, NUS has many different pathways, as one can take up additional minors/majors, so oftentimes, it is difficult to find someone with a similar degree path to compare their proposed study maps with. As such, having an optimally generated module roadmap that is customisable can be very helpful for their university planning.

We hope to make the module planning process significantly easier for most students, by being a central place for the module requirements of each course and enabling each student to plan their module roadmap over the entire course of study based on their requirements and preferences. The students would also be able to view issues, if any, in their roadmap such as not meeting the module application criteria.

This project was built using ReactJS, NestJS and Supabase. A more in depth writeup regarding this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1foOU1kSgrwgTMGzBAYbM0iVod_GfRfPKN1_2mq-ZNCY/edit#).
